# CodSoft Data Science Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks I completed during my **1-month Data Science Internship** at **CodSoft**.  
Each task demonstrates different skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model building.

## 📌 Tasks Overview

### ** Iris Flower Classification**
- Built a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements.
- Used Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy score and confusion matrix.

### ** Movie Rating Prediction**
- Predicted movie ratings based on dataset features.
- Performed data cleaning, feature selection, and model training.
- Used Linear Regression for prediction.

### ** Titanic Survival Prediction**
- Predicted survival chances of Titanic passengers.
- Preprocessed dataset: handled missing values, encoded categorical data.
- Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

### ** Sales Prediction**
- Predicted future sales based on advertising expenditure.
- Built and trained a Linear Regression model.
- Visualized predictions with Matplotlib.
